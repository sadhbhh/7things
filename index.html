<h1>seven things to know about changing the world</h1>
  
<p>I’m not a journalist, or a politician. I’m a 17 year old watching the world around me.<p>
  
<p>I’m not writing to the world leaders or the billionaires or the CEOs of big companies. I’m writing to <em>you</em>, whoever you are. The world needs you to recognise the power that you have. The world needs you to look at yourself, to look around you. To see what needs to change and to change it. You have a voice, and therefore have all the power in the world. Use it.</p>

<p>I don’t know how this world came about. I don’t think it matters if you believe that God hand painted the Aurora Borealis or two little specks ran into each other. What  matters is that we have it and we’re making a mess, because all we’re taught to care about is fast food and big houses with swimming pools.</p>
