<h1>seven things to know about changing the world</h1>
  
<p>I’m not a journalist, or a politician. I’m a 17 year old watching the world around me.<p>
  
<p>I’m not writing to the world leaders or the billionaires or the CEOs of big companies. I’m writing to <em>you</em>, whoever you are. The world needs you to recognise the power that you have. The world needs you to look at yourself, to look around you. To see what needs to change and to change it. You have a voice, and therefore have all the power in the world. Use it.</p>

<p>I don’t know how this world came about. I don’t think it matters if you believe that God hand painted the Aurora Borealis or two little specks ran into each other. What  matters is that we have it and we’re making a mess, because all we’re taught to care about is fast food and big houses with swimming pools.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>1. We have built a system. A system that we are too afraid to let go of because we’ve never known anything else. But that system will be the end of us. That system is killing our planet. As terrifying as it is we need to change how we live. This is not about influencers promoting the use of metal straws on their instagram stories and this is not political. This is real change and we need to fight for it. This is abandoning oil rigs, using renewable sources of energy. It’s putting solar panels on your house, but on a global scale. It will be hard and it will take work, but survival always does.
 </p></li>
  <li><p>2. Hate comes from fear. Fear of being hurt, fear of losing control, fear of the unknown. Hate always boils down to fear. If you want to eliminate hate you must eliminate fear.</p></li>
  <li><p>3. From terrorism to shoplifting to drug sales to gang violence, crime is everywhere. We like to punish people for crime, lock them up and strip them of hope, but we’re not getting to the root of the problem that way. We’re not counteracting, we’re just reprimanding, and no one is willing to admit that it’s not working because it’s all we’ve ever done. People will say that crimes are committed for the sake of an adrenaline rush or for a laugh, but that’s never the sole purpose. Crime is inherently deeper than that as it’s rebellion towards the rules that we, as a society, are required to live by through orders from the state. Rebellion is never just for fun; there are ALWAYS contributing factors. ALWAYS. Disadvantaged childhoods, addiction, exposure to gangs, mental health issues, abuse, war trauma, radicalisation - these are the things we should be tackling. It’s about prevention, not punishment. It’s about caring about people before they’re in a prison cell.</p></li>
  <li><p>4. In regards to women’s rights, different countries need to take different steps, and some just need to stop going backwards. Many less developed countries seem to be moving forward in regards to women’s rights, while also dealing with a multitude of different non-social issues. Girls are more encouraged to go to school and pursue a career of their own, and I think that’s an excellent step. In the west however, reproductive laws and the rights women have over their own bodies are questionable. Women make up half of this world’s population and we literally would not be alive without them. We can’t really move forward when half of the population is left behind.</p></li>
  <li><p>5. Religion is a beautiful thing and should not be used as an excuse to hate. I myself am not a religious person, but I understand that it is so important to people and such a powerful part of human history and of many different cultures. It can allow you to build a good moral compass and it can help you find your way through dark times. It is a beautiful thing that has been used consistently throughout history to make people’s lives miserable. The oppression of women, the killing of LGBTQ citizens, terrorism, concentration camps, child sex abuse, the list goes on. I don’t care what you believe, but you can’t believe that this is right. Religions are built on morality and love, that is what’s at their core. So why have they been morphed into an excuse to kill and discriminate?</p></li>
  <li><p>6. We need to change how we see success. We have this toxic idea that success is fancy cars and luxurious holidays. It shouldn’t be. We shouldn’t be told to go to school in order to get a job that makes money. Having money as an ultimate goal is so problematic. We should go to school to find our passions and talents, that in turn can help us overcome global and personal challenges. If you live your life being kind, making positive change in the world no matter how small, and overcoming all the things that challenge you? That is success. Money will end up meaning nothing anyway if we keep going on the way we are.
</p></li>
  <li><p>7. This is our turning point. This is the part where we make a choice. The part where we decide that the world is worth saving and that minorities deserve to be equal. This when we let go of hate, and embrace the fear. Because we should be scared, but not of each other. Not any more. This is the part where we come together. This is the part where you raise your voice.</p></li>
